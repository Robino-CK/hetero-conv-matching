# Heterogeneous Graph Coarsening (Work in Progress)

This repository hosts the code and experiments for an ongoing research project on **heterogeneous graph coarsening**. The goal is to develop and evaluate **data-driven methods** that reduce the size of large-scale heterogeneous graphs while preserving their structural and semantic properties.

## ðŸš§ Project Status

> This project is **still under development**. Some components may be incomplete or subject to change. Final results, trained models, and detailed documentation will be provided once the research is finalized.

## ðŸ§  Research Objective

Traditional graph coarsening methods are limited when applied to **heterogeneous graphs**â€”graphs with multiple types of nodes and/or edges. This project aims to:

- Propose novel coarsening techniques for heterogeneous structures.
- Leverage machine learning models to learn coarsening policies.
- Evaluate coarsening impact on downstream tasks (e.g., node classification).
